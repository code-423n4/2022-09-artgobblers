@frankie @t11s Is there a place we can read more about the shuffling algorithm and its purpose?


[09/21/2022 11:39 AM] oridabush
From what I understand it chooses 2 ids every time, one is the next revealed id and the other one is the revealed id + random distance, and switches their idx which is their id if it is the first time they are chosen or the stored idx if they were already chosen. Every time this happens the swap index (which is the index of the current id) determines the multiplier of the gobbler. And the indexes are chosen only from the unrevealed gobblers to avoid overriding the multipliers.
Is this correct?

We profiled the costs of chainlink v1 and v2, and found v1 to be cheaper. This is likely because under the v2 cost model, you have to pay for the gas used in verification and in the callback (which is subsidized in v1)

Question about the gamification, not really an issue:

It seems like the `mintLegendaryGobbler` function takes an array of N standard gobblers, calculates the number M <= N of required gobblers that need to be burnt to generate a legendary gobbler and then burns the first M elements of the array. The newly created gobbler will have 2x the `emissionMultiple` of the burnt gobblers.

This means that the order of the array changes the output (performance) of the legendary gobbler, so the user might (mistakenly) create a worse gobbler than what's possible by providing a suboptimal order of `gobblerIds`. 

Is this analysis correct?


[09/22/2022 1:06 AM] frankieislost
That is correct, the function is not order invariant

Q: any reason to check only for `msg.sender` for NFT operations instead of also `getApproved`/ `isApprovedForAll` ? e.g. on function `gobble` of `ArtGobblers.sol`:

```
        // The caller must own the gobbler they're feeding.
        if (owner != msg.sender) revert OwnerMismatch(owner);
```

I would expect this logic to be

```
if(owner != msg.sender || !isApprovedForAll(owner, msg.sender) || getApproved(tokenId) != msg.sender) revert OwnerMismatch(owner);
```

tat's an interesting question, I guess that does make sense given the semantics of `isApprovedForAll`

[09/22/2022 11:24 AM] rustyrabbit
Given the dramas we've already seen around approvals and the irreversible nature of `gobble()` I think it's a prudent approach although one that shuts out any NFT held by a SC wallet.


[09/22/2022 11:29 AM] rustyrabbit
What's the goal though about keeping track of which NFTs have been gobbled up by which Gobbler ? `getCopiesOfArtGobbledByGobbler` isn't used anywhere else.


[09/22/2022 1:15 PM] pedr02b2
thanks for the clarification i came here to ask basically the same question


[09/22/2022 3:50 PM] johnnytime
Never seen this Syntax before 👀
After execution: 
1) gobblerId = currentNonLegendaryId + 1?
2) currentNonLegendaryId = currentNonLegendaryId + 1 

Can someone please clarify?

[09/22/2022 4:00 PM] 0xsmartcontract
events can do many things
It can write to both transaction receipts and has the ability to write to states at the same time.

```  
 event GobblerClaimed(address indexed user, uint256 indexed gobblerId);

we wonder; What can events not do?

divide both sides by sqrt(s), you get ds/sqrt(s) on the left, which equals 2sqrt(s) + C when integrated. right side has sqrt(m)  dt, which integrates to sqrt(m) t

@t11s Have a question via DM.


[09/24/2022 6:39 PM] horsefacts
The cost of a legendary gobbler in terms of normal gobblers is determined by a dutch auction (the price starts high and decreases over time). That means the caller might provide more gobblers than required when they mint a legendary (since the price might decrease between when they submit the transaction and when it's actually executed). This test shows that if the caller provides extra gobblers in that situation, the extra tokens are not burned.

the code does nothing with the gobbled NFTs, which means it will be up to external/extension projects to deal with those. This external projects can opt in to only consider gobbled pages, which makes me believe that limiting it doesn't make sense

I came across this very cool NFT project called art gobbler.

I built an art gobbler indexer to index the gobble event when an NFT is fed into the art gobbler via the function gobble

This project is highly experimental. Definitely there should be high vulnerability, unfortunately i'm not yet on that level. 
I guess if you reached that 'level' , you must have a very wild imagination and creativity, not only high in technical skills.

We've just made a gobblers pool called VoltronGobblers, it can formed gobblers together, and there will be stronger ones.

Method    Time
Div: i / 4    358
Div: i >> 2    224
Mul: i * 4    206
Mul: i << 2    255
Mod: i % 4    918
Mod: i & 3    254 mul is a quicker computational wise than bitwise shift

honestly I submit this finding as a high vulernability in the report.


[09/29/2022 6:30 PM] ladboy233
I just locate where the code breaks. but I am sure that are auditor smarter than me can figure out why it breaks...

it wasnt, it was opened after thecontest ended

[10/01/2022 5:21 PM] ladboy233
well for that will leave it to judges. finger crossed for the report. :4739_Skeletor:


[10/01/2022 5:25 PM] philogy
But what does the bug mean exactly? VRGDA pricing breaks once 1731 Gobblers have been minted or on day 1731? Would be interested to understand it better


[10/01/2022 5:31 PM] ladboy233
my hope is high this counts because the issue opens after contest end. my report includes this one before the contest end


[10/01/2022 5:31 PM] ladboy233
all I know is if we mint 3000 nft or 5000 nft at once


[10/01/2022 5:31 PM] ladboy233
it break at 1731th


[10/01/2022 5:31 PM] ladboy233
I do not know why either ；）


[10/01/2022 5:32 PM] ladboy233

you can easily check it with tests.

[10/03/2022 6:53 AM] pfapostol
yes, I have, but I'm not sure if we are allowed to share PoC before the vulnerability is fixed, or at least the report is released

Ohh yeah. I see. Then can you share it after release of the report. Surely it'll be release soon

I agree, I guess c4 should do something like sherlock, where medium and high are rewarded. Or maybe a middle solution. Awards for medium and high are priority, so when they are judged there is a first release for awards; then gas (it seems easier to judge than QA, maybe I am wrong) and finally QA


[11/17/2022 8:33 PM] carlitox477
What's more, after medium and high are awarded, wardens/masons can help to write the report for those vulnerabilities. Warden/masons will learn a lot, and I think judges will have less job doing this


[11/17/2022 8:35 PM] carlitox477

in most cases this indicates an invalid report.

if the High and Mid are not invalid, what about Gas and QA they absolutely valid !


[11/22/2022 10:49 AM] bnke0x0
You should open a help ticket

[11/22/2022 11:04 AM] cryptostaker
does the report utilize the new gas payouts? ie does ++i still work here?


[11/22/2022 11:09 AM] pfapostol
yes. no.


[11/22/2022 11:51 AM] c3phas.
It's not guaranteed that Gas/QA will be valid, Or could be valid but unsatisfactory under the judges metrics


[11/22/2022 12:14 PM] cloudellie
Yes, this is one of the most significant changes we made. "Unsatisfactory" reports are no longer awarded, regardless of whether they are technically valid.

I closed reports that scored below 5 / 100 for QA and Gas


[11/22/2022 2:56 PM] alextheentreprenerd
In new contests I close reports that score below 60


[11/22/2022 3:00 PM] pfapostol
Is there a new scoring system in findings.csv, or i am missing something? there are only `1`, `2`, `3`, but no old scores.


[11/22/2022 3:03 PM] alextheentreprenerd
I score each report  based on the number of findings, then based on the best rate the rest


[11/22/2022 4:40 PM] rustyrabbit
Will a report be released for this one ?


[11/22/2022 4:42 PM] alextheentreprenerd
100%, just needs time for the report to be created

Noticed that some HM issues are scored as a 2 and seems there is only 1 of each issue scored. 2 indicates main issue?


[11/22/2022 7:43 PM] TurnipBoy#5973
Is 30% bonus for main implemented yet? In golom for solo mediums pie is 3.9 but slice is only 3


[11/22/2022 7:43 PM] alextheentreprenerd
No bonus on this contest, fwicr

As for math, tagging @CloudEllie | C4 as I'm not sure


[11/22/2022 7:45 PM] TurnipBoy#5973
Okay cool. Depending on which column is used to calc point denominator slice/pie could make a big difference


[11/22/2022 7:45 PM] TurnipBoy#5973
i.e. adding 3.9 points to denominator but only paying 3


[11/22/2022 8:09 PM] TurnipBoy#5973
Awards total to the full amount so no issues on that. Still curious about slice/pie though
